= Using Cocoon P2P in non-Flex / pure-AS3 projects =

As of version 0.82 Cocoon P2P can also be used in non-Flex projects (e.g. AS3 Projects in Flash Builder, Flash Projects in Flash CS 5, AS3 Projects in FDT, etc.). 

To use the non-Flex (pure AS3) version make sure to [WhichOneIsTheCorrectVersion download the correct SWC] or set the correct compiler flags when [BuildFromSource compiling from source].

Some key differences / important things:

  * in the AS3 version the properties _clients_, _sharedObjects_ and _receivedObjects_ of the !LocalNetworkDiscovery class are *typed Vectors* 
  * in the Flex version the properties _clients_, _sharedObjects_ and _receivedObjects_ of the !LocalNetworkDiscovery class are *!ArrayCollections* 
  * the AS3 version can be used in Flex as well (of course), but it *does not support Data Binding*

An example AS3 project (ZIP file) is available in the [http://code.google.com/p/cocoon-p2p/downloads/list downloads section]
